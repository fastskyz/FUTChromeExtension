# FUT Chrome Extension
A Chrome Extension to modify and play with the FIFA Web App JS

### About
Chrome does not want you to be able to execute JS code from within the loaded web page for security reasons.
Their solution is running the extension as a seperate HTML page and allow you to communicate with the users page through a 'bridge'.
This 'bridge' only allows you to insert/modify CSS and HTML on the users page.
I wanted to access the users page JS variables and execute custom code, so I built a little work around.


This is coded and tested based on the FIFA 21 Web APP from EA Sports.
The extension is by no means safe to use and could result in a ban for the use of a 'bot' or automated actions.
For me it was more about being able to execute custom JS than it was about trying to automate the Web App.

### Current functions

Right now this extension can just read out some data from the logged in user like transfermarket items and coins.

### Future
It is very unlikely that this will get update in the future since my main goal has been reached: __Executing custom JS code on the users page__. \
But hey, you never know :)
